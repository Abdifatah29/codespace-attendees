                    <p>“Our mission is to bridge the learning divide within the developing world by providing education
                        that empowers people to imagine and create technology. The global tech industry offers a unique
                        opportunity for young people to break through educational barriers and become innovators and job
                        creators.”</p>

                    <!-- quote from Emma -->
                    <p>“As a social enterprise, we directly address societal inequities within South Africa. CodeSpace’s
                        particular mandate is to increase gender, racial and socio-economic diversity in the tech
                        industry. We actively seek to create inclusive learning spaces for underrepresented groups in
                        the tech industry and to this end we run the “Code4CT” community for young female tech leaders.
                        To break down financial barriers to education, we offer bursaries & financing”</p>

                    <p>“By harnessing the power of technology to re-imagine what a learning environment looks like, we
                        make education more effective and efficient. Our world-class online learning portal allows
                        students to direct their own learning and move at the pace they need.”</p>
